<p>
Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless
editor. It is used primarely to edit text, including text
documents, source code of programs, web pages and XML documents,
but can also be used to display and edit binary files.
</p>

<p>
Emacs allows efficient editing of text with shortcuts which
allow operating on letters, words, sentences, and paragraphs as
single units. This includes both moving around and operations
like copying, deleting, transposing, and pasting. Macros can be
conveniently defined to repeat sequences of commands. In
addition, Emacs is (partially) built in a scripting language
(elisp) which can also be used to define further functions
extending existing capabilities.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has extensive support for editing source code, including
programmable syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, source
code indexing, overview modes, and navigation based on language
specific units like functions and blocks. It is also possible to
invoke the compiler from within Emacs and easily move between
compiler output and corresponding positions in the source.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has multiple modules which provide further functionality.
This provides the capability to read mail, news, browse
pictures, read man and info pages, browse the web, execute
arbitrary programs, and more, without leaving the editor.
